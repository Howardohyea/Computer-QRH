# Computer-QRH
a quick, comprehensive guide to building and troubleshooting basic PC problems

this is HEAVILY WIP, as I'm moving everything from a word document to this GitHub project

Alternatively, check this finished guide out in the meantime: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12F3AxP4LVmn4_JSFSkIzYDcZlmYdpqMd (I will no longer update this document, as all future information will go here)

## Reporting issues
I might make some stupid mistakes, like spelling or incorrect formatting. In that case, submit an issue and I'll resolve it. 

The same goes for incorrect information which I haven't noticed when writing, just submit an issue.

## Contribute
If you feel like you have some changes or anything you want to implement, make a fork of this project, do your edit, then submit a pull request back to this project.
