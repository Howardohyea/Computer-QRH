# The Computer Guide
A guide to building a PC and troubleshoot whatever problems it have. All I've written here is very oversimplified but for the sake of simplicity I've omitted quite a bit of information.

For the actual guides, please click on the following:

- [Essential Information](Essential%20Information.md)
- [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md)


## Reporting issues
I might make some stupid mistakes, like spelling or incorrect formatting. In that case, submit an issue [right here](https://github.com/Howardohyea/The-Computer-Guide/issues) and I'll resolve it. 

The same goes for incorrect information which I haven't noticed when writing, just submit an issue, or if you want to fix it youself, see [Contribute](#contribute).

## Submitting Questions
Since GitHub doesn't have a very good comment system, just use [issues](https://github.com/Howardohyea/The-Computer-Guide/issues) to ask a question, and I'll respond.

## Contribute
If you feel like you have some changes or anything you want to implement, just make a fork of `Computer-QRH`, do your edit, then submit a pull request back to this project. I'm quite busy these days so any additional information is greatly appreciated. Also see [Contributing Guidelines](Assets/Contributing%20guidelines.md) for more information.

## Future Expansions
Now that I'm more or less finished with all the files and Markdowns, I'm going to slowly add more information and images, and I'm going to make this into a GitHub Pages site.
