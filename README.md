## Reporting issues
I might make some stupid mistakes, like spelling or incorrect formatting. In that case, submit an issue [right here](https://github.com/Howardohyea/Computer-QRH/issues) and I'll resolve it. 

The same goes for incorrect information which I haven't noticed when writing, just submit an issue, or if you want to fix it youself, see [Contribute](#contribute)
