# Contributing guidelines
Anyone is welcome to contribute, but under the following conditions:

1. Whatever information is added **must** be in good faith.
    - This means intentionally writing misinformation is *not* in good faith.
    - However, accidentally putting spelling mistakes and other minor errors is fine. If there's too much spelling mistakes, I will view this as spam
2. Frequent helpers will get the chance to be added as a collaborator, but before then, do your edits in the pull requests.
    - By "Frequent", I mean a minimum of one Pull Request per week, and a total number of 5 PR[^1]. If any of these is not met, then I will not add them as a direct contributor.

**I retain the right to carry out the ultimate decision, which may even be in direct violation of this guidelines**

[^1]: PR means Pull Requests, and will be referred like this for the remainder of this file.

<!-- this feels stupid writing this contributing guidelines when there's barely any traffic over here -->
