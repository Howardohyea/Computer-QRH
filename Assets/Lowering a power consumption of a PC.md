# Prerequisites 
Before you do anything to your system, BACK UP YOUR FILES! It's not that your PC will break, but rather a corrupted and unstable OS will make extracting those files much harder. 

Also, read [Essential Information](https://github.com/Howardohyea/Computer-QRH/blob/main/Essential%20Information.md) before you do anything.

## Softwares
You'll need some softwares to monitor your system, and these are:

1. [HWInfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/), a program that can monitor just about anything you can dream of on your system.
2. [ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/), which controls the CPU power and boosting behaviour.
3. Alternatively, for CPUs with unlocked multipliers:
    - [Intel XTU](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html) is Intel's software for overclocking their CPUs, can also used for undervolting.
    - [AMD Ryzen Master](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/ryzen-master) is AMD's alternative to XTU.
