AMD socket

AMD used only one socket for the past 5 years or so, but the iterations and versions of this is confusing. Hereâ€™s a brief rundown. Also note that Ryzen 4000 is based on 3000 series and will count towards 3000 series in this handbook.
Note that AM4 is DDR4 only.

300 series motherboard: Ryzen 1000 and 2000 support, PCIe 3

400 series motherboard: Ryzen 1000 to 3000 support, 5000 varies on BIOS revision, PCIe 3 for all CPUs.

B550 motherboard: official Ryzen 3000 and 5000 support, unofficial support for earlier CPUs. PCIe 4 but chipset is PCIe 3, only Ryzen 3000 and above can utilize PCIe 4.

X570 motherboard: Ryzen 2000, 3000 and 5000 support, unofficially supports earlier CPUs. Also have full PCIe 4 but requires Ryzen 3000 and above.
